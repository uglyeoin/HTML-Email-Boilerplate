# A HTML Email Boilerplate

First of all I would like to thank and give full credit to [Nicole Merline for this excellent tutorial](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-future-proof-responsive-email-without-media-queries--cms-23919) which I based this code upon.

I have changed the images to include image sizes as that makes life easier when trying to remember how large the image should be.  I have added a few more layouts and decided on the practice I personally would like to use for picking colours throughout the template.

I changed some naming conventions too.

This is a work in progress, it can be improved quote a lot consider this my first draft (in reality about 101st).

## How to use it

Just look in the code it's all commented.  There are also MailChimp tags so it will work immediately in MailChimp.

If you want support just raise an issue and I'll see if I can help.  This is a part time project I'm not going to troubleshoot email issues that are not created by the template as is.  You can use Stack Exchange for that.

### How to remove MailChimp.

For now it's there, but I'll make a separate version at some point without the codes.

TO remove it remove all references to:

mc:repeatable="options" 
mc:variant="  XXXX   " where x is the text
mc:edit

*|UNSUB|* - MailChimps unsubscribe link
*|UPDATE_PROFILE|* - MailChimps update profile link

 ## Can I use this commercially
 
 Go ahead
 
 ## The future
 
 I intend to make MailChimp and Non MailChimp versions.
 I intent to include a few more modules and styles, although I will leave the basic template as is
 I intend to give more people credit where I have used their teachings
